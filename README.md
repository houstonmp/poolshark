# Poolshark

A simple site to play small webgames with friends. 




## Description

This website came from a design challenge that I ran within a discord server that I am a part of. I had the idea to create a small project to practice using React.js. I felt the Tic-Tac-Toe was a natural progression to what I had already been working on within the framework. 

Beyond React, I also utilized [particles.js](https://particles.js.org/) in order to create the colored bubbles that drift across the screen. Check out some of the other submissions in the Acknowledgement section down below!

## Roadmap

- Add more games:
    - Connect 4
    - ?Chess?
    - ?Pool?

## My Design Process

I based my design off of an image that had glowing neon bar lights. I wanted to experiment with styling the letters and borders with css so that they appeared as if they were glowing. I thought **PoolShark** would be a good name considering its relationship to billiards and bar-games. The underwater theme was designed within Figma and implemented within React.js. I added the particles last because I felt that the website needed a bit more life.
