# Poolshark

A simple site to play small webgames with friends. 




## Description

This project came from a friendly design challenge that I ran within a small discord group I am in. I felt that a Tic-Tac-Toe game was a natural progression to what I had already been working on within React.js and opened it up to the others within the group.

Beyond React, I also utilized [particles.js](https://particles.js.org/) in order to create the colored bubbles that drift across the screen. Check out some of the other discord submissions in the Acknowledgement section down below!

## Roadmap

- Add more games:
    - Connect 4
    - Othello
    - TBD

## My Design Process

I based my design off of an image that had glowing neon bar lights. I wanted to experiment with styling the letters and borders with css so that they appeared as if they were glowing. I thought **PoolShark** would be a good name considering its relationship to billiards and bar-games. The underwater theme was designed within Figma and implemented within React.js. I added the particles last because I felt that the website needed a bit more life.
